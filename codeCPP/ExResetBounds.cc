/**
 * An example of solving the problem, changing variable bounds, and resolving.
 * The variable bounds are reset by changing the bounds in the KTRIProblem object.
 * Upper bounds for all variables are set to 7, making the original optimal solution infeasible.
 * Although any of the KTRIProblem object properties can be modified between calling solve(),
 * only variable bounds and KNITRO parameters (not including gradient and Hessian evaluation types)
 * will be reflected in future calls to solve.
